# Education, Digital Skills, and Life Satisfaction in Europe (ANCOVA Study, 2023)
This mini-project investigates how educational attainment (Bourdieu’s cultural capital) and digital competence (van Dijk’s digital divide framework) jointly relate to life satisfaction across European countries (EU-SILC & DESI 2023).
An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test whether differences in life satisfaction between education levels remain significant after controlling for national digital skills.
